        <p>Welcome to MetaMaskâ€™s Developer Documentation. MetaMask is the trailblazing tool enabling user interactions
          and experience on Web3. It is currently available as a browser extension and as a mobile app on both Android
          and iOS devices. The purpose of this documentation is to illustrate how to build a dapp with MetaMask.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can find the latest version of MetaMask on our <a href="https://metamask.io/">official website</a>
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Why MetaMask</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>MetaMask was created to meet the needs of secure and usable Ethereum-based web sites. In particular, it
          handles account management and connection the user to the blockchain.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/getting-started.html">Get started here</a></li>

              API</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/rpc-api.html">Learn more about our RPC API</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Account Management</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>MetaMask allows users to manage accounts and their keys in a variety of ways, including hardware wallets,
          while isolating them from the site context. This is a great security improvement over storing the user keys on
          a single central server, or even in local storage, which can allow for <a
            href="https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-etherdelta-hacked-in-dns-hijacking-scheme/">mass account
            thefts.</a></p>
        <p>This security feature also comes with developer convenience: For developers, you simply interact with the
          globally available <code>ethereum</code> API that identifies the users of web3-compatible browsers (like
          MetaMask users), and whenever you request a transaction signature (like <code>eth_sendTransaction,
            eth_signTypedData</code> or others), MetaMask will prompt the user in as comprehensible a way as possible.
          This keeps users informed, and leaves attackers only the option of trying to phish individual users, rather
          than performing mass hacks (although <a
            href="https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168">DNS hacks can still be
            used for phishing en masse</a>).</p>
        <h3>Blockchain Connection</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>MetaMask comes pre-loaded with fast connections to the Ethereum blockchain and several test networks via our
          friends at <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>. This allows you to get started without synchronizing a
          full node, while still providing the option to upgrade your security and use the blockchain provider of your
          choice.</p>
        <p>Today, MetaMask is compatible with any blockchain that exposes an <a
            href="https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API">Ethereum-compatible JSON RPC API</a>, including custom and private
          blockchains. For development, we recommend running a test blockchain like <a
            href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a>.</p>
        <p>We are aware that there are constantly new private blockchains being created. If you are interested in
          integrating MetaMask with your own custom network, <a
            href="https://medium.com/metamask/connect-users-to-layer-2-networks-with-the-metamask-custom-networks-api-d0873fac51e5">we
            have an API that has already enabled a number of networks to do the same</a>.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Getting_Started">
      <header>Getting Started</header>
        <p>To develop for MetaMask, install MetaMask in the browser of your choice on your development machine. <a
            href="https://metamask.io/">Download here</a>.</p>
        <p>Once MetaMask is installed and running (make sure you back up your Secret Recovery Phrase), you should find
          that new browser tabs have a <code class="code-normal">window.ethereum</code> object available in the
          developer console. This is how your website will interact with MetaMask.</p>
        <p>You can review the full API for that object <a
            href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html">here</a>. Note that <strong>over the course of
            2020</strong>, we introduced significant changes to this API, and we recommend that you refer to its
          documentation.<p>
            <h3>Basic Considerations</h3>
            <hr />
            <h4>Web3 Browser Detection</h4>
            <p>To verify if the browser is running MetaMask, copy and paste the code snippet below in the developer
              console of your web browser:</p>
            <p class="code-dark"><code>if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
                <br>
                console.log('MetaMask is installed!');
                <br>
                }</code></p>
            <p>You can review the full API for the <code class="code-normal">window.ethereum</code> object <a
                href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Running a Test Network</h3>
            <p>In the top right menu of MetaMask, select the network that you are currently connected to. Among several
              popular defaults, you'll find <code class="code-normal">Custom RPC</code> and <code
                class="code-normal">Localhost 8545</code>. These are both useful for connecting to a test blockchain,
              like <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">ganache</a>. You can quickly install and start Ganache
              if you have <code class="code-normal">npm</code> installed with <code class="code-normal">npm i -g
                ganache-cli && ganache-cli</code>.</p>
            <p>Ganache has some great features for starting your application with different states. If you application
              starts with the <code class="code-normal">-m</code> flag, you can feed it the same seed phrase you have in
              your MetaMask, and the test network will give each of your first 10 accoutns 100 test ether, which makes
              it easier to start work.</p>
            <p>Since your seed phrase has the power to control all your accounts, it is probably worth keeping at least
              one seed phrase for development, separate from any that you use for storing real value. One easy way to
              manage multiple seed phrases with MetaMask, is with multiple browser profiles, each of which can have its
              own clean extension installations.</p>
            <h5>Resetting Your Local Nonce Calculation</h5>
            <p>If you're running a test blockchain and restart it, you can accidentally confuse MetaMask because it
              calculates the next <a href="">nonce</a> based on both the network state <i>and</i> the known sent
              transactions.</p>
            <p>To clear MetaMask's transaction queue, and effectively reset its nonce calculation, you can use the <code
                class="code-normal">Reset Account</code> button in <code class="code-normal">Settings</code> (available
              in the top-right identicon menu).<p>
                <h3>Detecting MetaMask</h3>
                <p>If you want to differentiate MetaMask from other Ethereum-compatible browsers, you can detect
                  MetaMask using <code class="code-normal">ethereum.isMetaMask</code>.</p>
                <h3>User state</h3>
                <p>Currently there are a few stateful things to consider when interacting with this API:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What is the current network?</li>
                  <li>What is the current account?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Both of these are available synchronously as <code class="code-normal">ethereum.networkVersion</code>
                  and <code class="code-normal">ethereum.selectedAddress</code>. You can listen for changes using events
                  too, see (<a href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html">the API reference</a>).</p>
                <h3>Connecting to MetaMask</h3>
                <p>"Connecting" or "logging in" to MetaMask effectively means "to access the user's Ethereum
                  account(s)".</p>
                <p>You should <strong>only</strong> initiate a connection request in response to direct user action,
                  such as clicking a button. You should <strong>always</strong> disable the "connect" button while the
                  connection request is pending. You should <strong>never</strong> initiate a connection request on page
                  load.</p>
                <p>We recommend that you provide a button to allow the user to connect MetaMask to your dapp. Clicking
                  this button should call the following method:</p>
                <p class="code-dark">
                  <code>ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });</code>
                </p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <input type="button" value="Enable Ethereum" onclick="alert('clicked!');"></input>
                <h5>Javascript</h5>
                <p class="code-dark">
                  <code>const ethereumButton = document.querySelector('.enableEthereumButton');<br><br>
                    ethereumButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
                    <br>
                    //Will Start the metamask extension <br>
                    ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
                    <br>
                    });</code>
                </p>
                <p>This promise-returning function resolves with an array of hex-prefixed Ethereum addresses, which can
                  be used as general account references when sending transactions.</p>
                <p>Over time, this method is intended to grow to include various additional parameters to help your site
                  request everything it needs from the user during setup.</p>
                <p>Since it returns a promise, if you're in an <code class="code-normal">async</code> function, you may
                  log in like this:</p>
                <p class="code-dark">
                  <code>
                    const accounts = await ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });<br>
                    const account = accounts[0];<br>
                    // We currently only ever provide a single account,<br>
                    // but the array gives us some room to grow.
                  </code>
                </p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <input type="button" value="Enable Ethereum" onclick="alert('clicked!');"></input>
                <p class="code-dark">
                  <code>const ethereumButton = document.querySelector('.enableEthereumButton');<br>
                    const showAccount = document.querySelector('.showAccount');<br><br>
                    ethereumButton.addEventListener('click', () => { <br>
                    getAccount();<br>
                    });<br><br>

                    async function getAccount() {<br>
                    const accounts = await ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });<br>
                    const account = accounts[0];<br>
                    showAccount.innerHTML = account;<br>
                    }
                  </code>
                </p>
                <h3>Choosing a Convenience Library</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>Convenience libraries exist for a variety of reasons.</p>
                <p>Some of them simplify the creation of specific user interface elements, some entirely manage the user
                  account onboarding, and others give you a variety of methods of interacting with smart contracts, for
                  a variety of API preferences, from promises, to callbacks, to strong types, and so on.</p>
                <p>The provider API itself is very simple, and wraps <a
                    href="https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#json-rpc-methods">Ethereum JSON-RPC</a> formatted messages,
                  which is why developers usually use a convenience library for interacting with the provider, like <a
                    href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers">ethers</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3">web3.js</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/">truffle</a>, <a
                    href="https://framework.embarklabs.io/">Embark</a>, or others. From those tools, you can generally
                  find sufficient documentation to interact with the provider, without reading this lower-level API.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Initializing_Dapps">
      <header>Initializing Dapps</header>
      <p>Once you have your basic dev environment <a href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/Getting-Started">set up</a>,
        you are ready to start interacting with some smart contracts. There are some basic things you'll need,
        regardless of what convenience library you're using, when communicating with a smart contract:</p>
      <h3>The Contract Network</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>If you aren't connected to the right network, you aren't going to have any luck sending transactions to your
        contract, so make sure you have this right! Many dapp developers choose to deploy their contract to a testnet
        first, in order to avoid potentially disastrous fees if something goes wrong during development and testing on
        mainnet.</p>
      <p>No matter which network you deploy your final dapp on, your user will need to be able to access it. MetaMask
        makes available <a
          href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/rpc-api.html#other-rpc-methods">wallet_switchEthereumChain</a>, as well
        as <a href="https://docs.metamask.io/guide/rpc-api.html#wallet-addethereumchain">wallet_addEthereumChain</a>,
        which allows you to prompt the user to add a chain that you suggest, and switch to it using a confirmation
        dialogue.</p>
      <h3>The Contract Address</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>Every account in Ethereum has an address, whether it's an external key-pair account, or a smart contract. In
        order for any smart contract library to communicate with your contracts, they'll need to know its exact address.
        If you deployed a contract, you probably know how to find the address, but if you're just getting started, check
        out our Knowledgebase <a
          href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059683451-How-to-view-or-add-custom-token-contract-address">explainer
          on finding contract addresses.</a></p>
      <h3>The Contract ABI</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>In Ethereum, <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html">The ABI Specification</a> is a
        way to encode the interface of a smart contract in a way that is comprehensible to your user interface. It is an
        array of method-describing objects, and when you feed this and the address into a contract-abstraction library,
        this ABI tells those libraries about what methods to provide, and how to compose transactions to call those
        methods.
        <p>Example libraries include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers">ethers</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3">web3.js</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://framework.embarklabs.io/">Embark</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethjs">ethjs</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/">truffle</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>The Contract Bytecode</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>If your web app is going to publish a new smart contract that is pre-compiled, it may need to include some
          <code class="code-normal">bytecode</code>. In this case, you will not know the contract address in advance,
          but instead will have to publish, watch for the transaction to be processed, and then extract the final
          contract's address from the completed transaction.</p>
        <p>If publishing a contract from bytecode, you will still want an <code class="code-normal">ABI</code> if you
          want to interact with it! The bytecode does not describe how to interact with the final contract.</p>
        <h3>The Contract Source Code</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>If your website is going to allow users to edit smart contract source code and compile it, like <a
            href="http://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix</a>, you may import a whole compiler. In this case you're going to
          derive your bytecode and ABI from that source code, and eventually you will derive the contract's address from
          the completed transaction, where that bytecode is published.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Accessing_Accounts">
      <header>Accessing Accounts</header>
      <p>User accounts are used in a variety of contexts in Ethereum, including as identifiers and for signing
        transactions. In order to request a signature from the user or have the user approve a transaction, one must be
        able to access the user's accounts. The <code class="code-normal">wallet methods</code> below involve a
        signature or transaction approval and all require the sending account as a function parameter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code class="code-normal">eth_sendTransaction</code></li>
        <li><code class="code-normal">eth_sign</code> (insecure and unadvised to use)</li>
        <li><code class="code-normal">personal_sign</code></li>
        <li><code class="code-normal">eth_signTypedData</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you've <a href="">connected to a user</a>, you can always re-check the current account by checking <code
          class="code-normal">ethereum.selectedAddress</code>.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <input type="button" value="Connect to MetaMask" onclick="alert('clicked!');"></input>
      </p>
      <p>If you'd like to be notified when the address changes, we have an event you can subscribe to:</p>
      <p class="code-dark">
        <code>ethereum.on('accountsChanged', function (accounts) {</code>
        <br />
        <code>// Time to reload your interface with accounts[0]!</code>
        <br />
        <code>});</code>
        </br>
        <p>If the first account in the returned array isn't the account you expected, you should notify the user! In the
          future, the accounts array may contain more than one account. This functionality isn't available yet. The
          first account in the array will always be considered the user's "selected" account.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Sending_Transactions">
      <header>Sending Transactions</header>
      <p>Transactions are a formal action on a blockchain. They are always initiated in MetaMask with a call to the
        <code class="code-normal">eth_sendTransaction</code> method. They can involve a simple sending of ether, may
        result in sending tokens, creating a new smart contract, or changing state on the blockchain in any number of
        ways. They are always initiated by a signature from an <i>external account</i>, or a simple key pair.</p>
      <p>In MetaMask, using the <code class="code-normal">ethereum.request</code> method directly, sending a transaction
        will involve composing an options object like this:</p>
      <p class="code-dark">
        <code>const transactionParameters = { <br>
          &emsp;nonce: '0x00', // ignored by MetaMask <br>
          &emsp;gasPrice: '0x09184e72a000', // customizable by user during MetaMask confirmation.<br>
          &emsp;gas: '0x2710', // customizable by user during MetaMask confirmation.<br>
          &emsp;to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Required except during contract publications.<br>
          &emsp;from: ethereum.selectedAddress, // must match user's active address.<br>
          &emsp;value: '0x00', // Only required to send ether to the recipient from the initiating external account.<br>
          &emsp;data:
          '0x7f7465737432000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000600057', // Optional, but used for
          defining smart contract creation and interaction.<br>
          chainId: '0x3', // Used to prevent transaction reuse across blockchains. Auto-filled by MetaMask.<br>
          };<br><br>

          // txHash is a hex string<br>
          // As with any RPC call, it may throw an error<br>
          const txHash = await ethereum.request({<br>
          &emsp;method: 'eth_sendTransaction',<br>
          &emsp;params: [transactionParameters],<br>
          });<br>
        </code>
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <hr />
      <input type="button" value="Enable Ethereum" onclick="alert('clicked!');"></input>
      <input type="button" id="green-btn" value="Send Eth" onclick="alert('clicked!');"></input>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Transaction Parameters</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>Many transaction parameters are handled for you by MetaMask, but it's good to know what all the parameters do.
      </p>
      <h4>Nonce [ignored]</h4>
      <p>This field is ignored by MetaMask.</p>
      <p>In Ethereum every transaction has a nonce. This is so that each transaction can only be processed by the
        blockchain once. Additionally, to be a valid transaction, the nonce must either be 0, or a transaction with the
        previous number must have already been processed.</p>
      <p>That means that transactions are always processed in order for a given account, and so incrementing nonces is a
        very sensitive matter that is easy to mess up, especially when a user is interacting with multiple applications
        with pending transactions using the same account, potentially across multiple devices.</p>
      <p>For these reasons, MetaMask currently does not provide application developers any way to customize the nonce of
        transactions it suggests. Instead, MetaMask <a
          href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251">assists the user in managing their
          transaction queue themselves</a>.</p>
      <h4>Gas Limit [optional]</h4>
      <p>Optional parameter. Rarely useful to Dapp developers.</p>
      <p>Gas limit is a highly optional parameter, and we automatically calculate a reasonable price for it. You will
        probably know that your smart contract benefits from a custom gas limit if it ever does for some reason.</p>
      <h4>To [semi-optional]</h4>
      <p>A hex-encoded Ethereum address. Required for transactions with a recipient (all transactions except for
        contract creation).</p>
      <p>Contract creation occurs when there is no <code class="code-normal">to</code> value but there is a <code
          class="code-normal">data</code> value.</p>
      <h4>Data [semi-optional]</h4>
      <p>Required for smart contract creation.</p>
      <p>This field is also used for specifying contract methods and their parameters. You can learn more about how that
        data is encoded on <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html">the solidity ABI spec</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Chain ID [currently ignored]</h4>
      <p>Chain ID is currently derived by the user's current selected network at <code
          class="code-normal">ethereum.networkVersion</code>. In the future we will probably allow a way to connect to
        multiple networks at once, at which point this parameter will become important, so it may be useful to be in the
        habit of including now.</p>
